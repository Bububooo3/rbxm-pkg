# Roadmap (TODO)

1. Add more packages (and probably store them in a better place so people can add new ones remotely)
2. Add manifests and lockfiles for dependencies and quick-installs
3. Make a user-friendly interface (beyond cmd prompt CLI)
4. Make Roblox plugin for easier user-interface and more control
5. Create documentation
